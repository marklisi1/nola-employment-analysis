City Innovation Stipends

Successful applicants will be awarded a City Innovation Stipend (up to $2,000) for taking on a voluntary, additional duties

employee’s normal working hours. Any time an employee spends on grant-related work is purely voluntary and not

payment of up to ($1,000) may be awarded upon implementation ofthe mnovation developed through the proposal.

Working Group shall assess proposals on the followmg criteria:

(1) Value creation
(2) Cost/feature of mplementation
(3) Impact on City business processes

In awarding stipends, the Working Group must determine that, ifsuccessfully implemented, the proposed mnovation would
produce at least the equivalent value ofthe stipend itself. This value may be expressed in saved time and/or money for the
City, partners, or community members or demonstrable improvements to City services.

Once the W orking Group awards a stipend, the CAO shall transmit to the Civil Service Department a form that contains:

1) The amount ofthe stipend
2) Employee(s) receiving the grant
3) The evaluation completed by the Working Group

The Civil Service Department will not be responsible for assessing the merits ofthe proposal or approving the payment.

CAO shall transmit to the Civil Service Department a form that contains:

1) The name ofthe employee(s) to be awarded the pay
2) A copy of the project charter
3) Statement fromthe Working Group that the project has been implemented as described in the project

charter

orapproving the payment.
